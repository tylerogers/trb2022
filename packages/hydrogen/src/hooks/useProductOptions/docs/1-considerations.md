#### Considerations

- If your product requires a selling plan, then make sure to display that as required in your user interface. If it doesn't require a selling plan, then you might want to offer a "one-time purchase" option which triggers `setSelectedSellingPlan(null)`.
- You can use `selectedSellingPlanAllocation` to display the price adjustments for the selected variant when a given selling plan is active.
